VPC
----
  vpc means virtual private cloud,
  you owned a private Datacenter for you inside AWS

what is CIDR Block?
  cidr means:
  classelss inter domain Routing!

basically VPC required IP range; 10.0.0.0/16
this 16 gives 65,536 ips- enough to create many subnets

1.what CIDR do you choose for a VPC and why
ans: choosing a large range like /16 so you can create many subnets later



Subnets(public & private)
-------------------------

vpc is divided into subnets
1.public subnets
  a subnets it has internet access
  it requires RouteTable -> InternetGateway

used for :
loadBalancer,NatGateway, Bastion Hosts

2.Private Subnets:
  no direct internet access

used for:
Appliction servers, Database,Redish,Internal services

1.how do you make a subnet private
Attach route: 0.0.0.0/0 -> Internet Gateway

INTERNET GATEWAY
----------------

a managed AWS component that allow (inbound+outbound internets) for public subnets
you attach one IGW per VPC

NAT GATEWAY
----------
private subnet cannot reach internet directly so we use NAT
expensie, fully managed, Highly availble & scales automatically

NAT INSTANCE
cheap but manual sccalable, ec2 insgtance as a NAT

why do private servers need internet?
to donwload patches, connect to s3, api calls  etc

Route tables
------------
decide how traffic flow

Security groups (SG)
--------------------

stateful -sg
  only allow rules
stateless- nacl 
  has allow + deney rules

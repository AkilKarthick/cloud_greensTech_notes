vpc -> virtual private cloud

how to find valid IP?
what is IP? a server

how IP is split up is 
 8.8.8.8 = total(32 bit)

each digit mazimum size is
0-255 = 256 total count

CIDR -> Classless inter domain routing

it will calculate the ip count

ipv4 = 32 bit range (we are goinng to see this)
ipv6 = 128 bit range

--------------------------
we are going to calculate ? 

out of 32bit  -32(if i plan to use 32 ) = 0 = 2 power of 0 = 1
32-31 = 1 = 2 power 1 = 2(total number of host/ ie 2 ip)
32-30 = 2 = 4 
32-29 = 3 = 8
32-28 = 4 = 16
32-27 = 5 = 32
32-26 = 6 = 64
32-25 = 7 = 128
32-24 = 8 = 256 (count of IP's)
   -23 =9 = 512
---------------

you can check this on CIDR calculator as well for more clarity!!

for EG: if you give 
10.0.0.0/24 on CIDR == you notive that 
        first IP is 10.0.0.0
        last IP is 10.0.0.255 (here last ip is fill)

10.0.0.0/23 on CIDR == you can see like
        first IP is 10.0.0.0
        last Ip is 10.0.1.255 (here once the last digit attain max 255 then it moved to next sessino) 

fourth 255 completed on 24th
thired 255 completed on 16th
second 255 completed on 8th

if client asked us for 1.5lakshs ip means? how you proceed?

how vpc works flow diagram

consider a box

whatever subnets i'm going to create must comes under my VPC range
subnets like

public subnet
10.0.1.0/24  - total 256IP alloted for subnets

private subnet
10.0.2.0/24  - ))

netowrk flow should be there for both the subnets

Internet Gateway- helup us to 

it will take the vpc n/w and via route table provide n/w to subnet
this is how the default vpc look like below 

myvpc--> igw --> public routetable ----(public security group )---> publicSubnet(public ec2)

natgateway= it will take the n/w from public subnet and provide it to private subnet via route table
here to we have a private security group
-----------------------------------------


open networking and conetne delivery on aws
select VPC
on the VPC dashboard

if you go to your VPC , there already one default vpc listed there don't do any thing there

step1: click on create VPC
        gave name like MY-VPC
        ipv4 cide as 10.0.0.0/16
        click on create VPC
step2: subnets (public & private)
        click on create subnets
        select your VPC ID ON create subnets in this vpc
        give subnet name: PUBSUB
        ipv4 cidr as 10.0.1.0/24 (we are going to allocate 256 IP's)
        click on create subnet

        create subnet for private too

click on create subnets
        select your VPC ID ON create subnets in this vpc
        give subnet name: PVTSUB
        ipv4 cidr as 10.0.2.0/24 (we are going to allocate 256 IP's)
        click on create subnet

next create Internet Gateway::
        create ig
        name : MY-IGW         
        click on create internet gateway. it's state is in DETACHED initially
        and later we can attach > click on Actions> attach to VPC
        select your vpc on the Available VPC's box
        click on attach internet gateway

now need to create Route Table,
        on the dashboard it shows two route table intially
        one is default one and other is our VPC's one
we are not going to use the abve , going to create a new one 
        create route table
        name: pubRT
        select your VPC
now edit that routetable, click on add route and do select your internet gateway & give
0.0.0.0 public ip, & do save the changes

now we are going to associate public subnet with public related internet gateway!!
on subnet assocation > click on edit assocation
select PUBSUB , and do Save assocations

now going to create route table for private
name: PVTRT        
selct your VPC, do create route abel
initially we don't have nat but we have that subnet association option to associate our subnet first
associate your pvtsub with pvtrt

security groups::
create new
name: PUB-SG
        Description: PUB-SG
        select your vpc too
        need to give inboud rules(yarulaam ulla varalam)
        inbout rules        type == ssh, rdp, http & https
        finally create seucity grou;s
name: PVT-SG
        Description: PVT-SG
        here in inboud rules, Type select "Custom TCP" 
        Source as custom and 
        select PUB-SG, means we give like
whom all are comes under pub subgroup only come here on private like that we setuped here

now create instances,
here imporatny on the network settings

select your VPC on vpc-required
select pubsub (public subnet )
auto assigne public ip- enabled
security group, select public-sG
do launch instance

for private instacnte
name: private
on n/w settings,
select your vpcc
you private subnet
and disbaled the auto assign public ip is disabled
secity group: pub private SG
do launh the instance

going to create NAT gateway
create 
name :         my-nat
subnet:    (pubsub)
do allocate Elastic IP

What is pod?
All the container were present inside this pod, this pod will provide n/w and storage that is required for the container. For each POD it have a unique IP address. 
Each pod is isolated from each other Pod , bcz each have unique IP 
We can create multiple Docker container in a single pod is possible
In real time application mostly for a single POD they maintain one container
Bcz if containter B failed & container A is running , but k8s will restart the POD so container A also need to 
Only for tighly coupled application they maintain in single pod
For creating an POD we need to provide via yml file 
Pod.yml
apiVersions:v1 //is always v1
Kind: Pod // means what are we going to create
Metadata: //pod extra information
	Name: podname (eg: my-simple-cal-pod
	Labels: 
		Project: calculator
Spec: //  here we inform about our container that runngin on our pod
	Containers:    //list of container
		Name:java-calc
		Image:adf/calaclut
		Port:
			containorPort: 8081
		name: java-backend
		image: simp/java-backend
		ports:
			containerPort: 8080
now how to creat a Pod from this yml file?
Kubectl apply -f   //  -f mena file
Kubectl apply -f pod.yml       //pod created
To see created pod
Kubectl get pods
To see pods Ip address
	get pods -o wide
 

Kubectl describe pods  pod-name    // tjis will return pod full details
--------------

A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
It contains one or more containers that share the same network and storage.
Every Pod has a unique IP address, making Pods isolated from each other.
In real-time projects, we usually run one container per Pod for better fault tolerance, except for tightly coupled sidecar patterns.
// it you wanna check whther the constinar is created or not to find the error on events!

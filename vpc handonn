step1: create new VPC
	name: MY-VPC | Ipv4 CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
create vpc

step2: subnets
select you VPC, MY-VPC there
Subnet name: PUBSUB & PVTSUB 
10.0.1.0/24 & 10.0.2.0/24

create two subnets

step3: internet gateway

name: MY-IGW
create this first then you need to attach 
go to ACTION > ATTACH VPC

step4: Route Tables
create public & private RT

name : PUBRT & PVTRT
select your vpc
create it

once you creat public route table,
go to edit route table> add route > internet gateway and 0.0.0.0 & select your internet gateway there

now association of pubsubnet with pub route table

do the subnet association of privat subnt, only because natgateway is not yet created 

stpe5: create security group now,
name: PUB-SG
select your : VPC : MY-VPC
inboud rules: ssh,http,https,rdp source : anywhere

name: PVt-SG
select your vpc
add inbound rules like 
go to source search > select your public security grop created one & TYPE: ALL-TCP
create security group

stepp6: create EC2-instance windows

pub inst
select your vpc there
and public subnet for public instance & vice versa
AUTO ASSIGN public IP should enable for public only 
select your public security group for public instance

step7: create NAT gateway
name: MY-NAT
subnet: public subnet, why bcz we are creating it on pub subnet
also allocate elastic IP

launch your public windows machine via remote desktop
we connected internet gateway right so n/w will be there

now launch your private instance using private IP address inside your public machine Remote machine

on private machine n/w not preented initially so you need to connect NAT 

now edit your pvtrt and add route > natgateway select your nat gateway and do save changes

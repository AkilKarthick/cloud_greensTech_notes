Cloud front & cloud formation

1.cloud front = 
  cdn tool
  content delivery network tool
  for eg, to make the appliction to reach the user soon latency based up on application
eg: hotstar la latency ilama pakaura cricket live match
  for static conent delivery we use cloud front not for dynamic content
  only to reduce latency
    
Edge location = 
cache servers = temporary server 

for EG, we have 2 dataceter(orginal server's) in india, so 6 
      chennai , kolkata ,(edgelocation[cache server's])
      like that we placed some edge location on small places



2.cloud formation


-------for demo

to use cloud front , i need a source i make it as S3
1.create a cloud front distribution
  distribution name: new-cf
  single website or app   > next

specify orgin,
  orgin type: amazon s3 ,,you can select elb,vpc etc
        create a s3 on the same time
          create bucket> general purpose> name > acl enabled> enable> make it as public
          put any file there
        you get the object URL (on northen virgina)
        
        if i try to acess this on india we may feel some latency
--
2.now ,

select your bcuket on s3 by browse
orgin path-optional

ENABLE SECURITY!!!!
3. Web Application Firewall (WAF)
  if you want enable it/ no need
4. do create distriubution

you will get a new distribution domain name url
  eg: d329mkdjfasdf.cloudfront.net like this

hit this url like belwo

http://d329mkdjfasdf.cloudfront.net/cars/jpg  = not rachable

it will take some time to deploy,,

https://d329mkdjfasdf.cloudfront.net/cars/jpg = this will work

you hace crated this on multiple regions, so by default it will be in allow all region
we can restrict that by go to the 
cloud front geographic restrictions,

delete that s3 data objcet now, we have delete that src bucekt now
now even src bucket is deleted , but we able to hit this url 
https://d329mkdjfasdf.cloudfront.net/cars/jpg = this will work , cache server wil work

we can restrict edit countries> if you block india means
it will not work shoe block access from your country!!!


kindly do check that invaliation creation part!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Invalidating the CloudFront cache is essential when you need to remove
outdated content from CloudFront edge caches before it expires. 
This ensures that users receive the most up-to-date content from your origin servers.

----------------

we cann't able to delete the cloud front distribtion , we can diable that it will took some time
to terminate that

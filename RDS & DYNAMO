 
RDS & DYNAMO

database,
 types of date::
structured      = infomration only we can put inside (for eg: EXCEL )   -- RDS used here
semi-structured = both way we can store data  --  no sql : dynamoDB
un structed     = video, audio , pdf, etc (we store in S3, EBS, EFS )

EXCEL we have rows & colums

--------

RDS
 we are going to create RDS 
login to AWS account,
seasearch for Aurora and RDS,

hint--

on vpc concept, we put database and backe on private subnet &
                fronet end on public subnet
if we want to more secure , we can put front end on private and load balancer on public then we expose
based up on organiztion and devops enginner convinent
------------

now if you need to create RDS you need -subnet groups- first
create a subnet for RDS
name:db-sub
description: db-sub
vpc: select you vpc 
availaibity zone: availibilty zone select or chose AZ
subnets: select subnet included on the AZ
click on CREATE database
 1.choose a DATABASE creation method
standard create
Easy create
2.Select Engine oPTIONs /engine type
  Mysql or postgreSQL
Aurora(Mysql compatabile) - aws managed SQL, 5times faster then mysql
Select Engine Version, for EG: Mysql 8.0.41
then
Templates, choose either
prodcuion 
or Dev/Test
or free tier

then 
Availability & durability, select deployment option
   Mutli AZ db cluster deployment (3 instance)
   mutli AAZ instance Deployment (2 INSTANCE)
   single AZ db insance deployment (1 instance)   = select this one

then
Settings
 DB instane identifier- means name 
then 
Credentials Setting
 Master Username: admin
select > Self Managed(create your own password or have RDS create a pwd that you manage)
Master password:   admin123
confim password:   admin123

then 
instance configuration,
    standard clasee - min 8gb
    memory optijmzed class - min 16gb
    burstable class - 1gb   cost you 18dollars

then on Storage
storage type,
 for Provisioned IOPS itslef we are spending 300dollars, 
 so change it to Ge neral purpose SSD
  Allocated Storage is min 20 is fine

now cost changed to 2dollar

then , on Connectivity
select Don't connect to an EC2 instance

VPC, select your vpc
public access> alway select NO

backup> enable autoomated bakcup
backup retention period > 7 days
disable> enable deletion protection

finally create database 

---mean while create and Ec2 instance---
select all tcp on common security group
    why because to connect secerutiy group 22port, 3360 port too

hit---
i put my database(RDS) not on single AZ i put on multiple AZ, for login purpose
consider like if  take backup means it's not a cluster it is an unique instance only
if i connecftefd these below RDS together means - cluster- 
      RDS - replica
      RDS - master
      RDS - replica

cluster- more instance connected together means cluster

master  - write
replica - read 
-------
RDS - prvide one endpoint url , we create username & password
application- datea logsi prsen here including queryeis

-------

now on created ubuntu what we need to do is?


sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server -y
mysql 
musql -v
sudo -i
musql -v
sql> now we got into mysql
 we are just configured myusql on our local machine  using the above command

=============

now how to connect created database to our ec2 instacne
open that created db> on connectivity & security tab> you can see the endpoint url
--------
mysql -h database-1.cz2aimoogxp.ap-south-1.rds.amaonaws.com -P 3306 -u admin -p
password: admin123
----------------- we able to see sql version of what we give on RDS while creating
we are connectiong databse to our ec2 instance using endpoint,

show databases;

if you want to increse  capacity, go to modify> downtime happend
if you want to avoid downtime> go to action> create read replica >
convert to multi AZ- deploument first to - create read replica

finally delete the databaseinstance (delet me)
also delete the subnet group too
terminate the EC2 instance as well
--------------------------

Dynamo DB,

managed no sql databse

we pay as per read & write operation not like mysql their it will show bill right

create table
name:  students
parition key: sid  number datatype select on dropdown
sort key-optional : name | string

no customized 
 you got 
ondemand  (automatic a varum) - simplfiyh billing by pay for the actila read and write your appcation perfomance
provisioned (neenga customized panrathu read/write) - manage and optimize your cost by allocation read/write capacity in advance


finallly create item
we can add attribute as per oour need on the table

you can add data via console or else aws sdk , amazon lambda via application you can code

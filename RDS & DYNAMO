RDS & DYNAMO

database,
 types of date::
structured      = infomration only we can put inside (for eg: EXCEL )   -- RDS used here
semi-structured = both way we can store data  --  no sql : dynamoDB
un structed     = video, audio , pdf, etc (we store in S3, EBS, EFS )

EXCEL we have rows & colums

--------

RDS
 we are going to create RDS 
login to AWS account,
seasearch for Aurora and RDS,

hint--

on vpc concept, we put database and backe on private subnet &
                fronet end on public subnet
if we want to more secure , we can put front end on private and load balancer on public then we expose
based up on organiztion and devops enginner convinent
------------

now if you need to create RDS you need -subnet groups- first
create a subnet for RDS
name:db-sub
description: db-sub
vpc: select you vpc 
availaibity zone: availibilty zone select or chose AZ
subnets: select subnet included on the AZ

hit---
i put my database(RDS) not on single AZ i put on multiple AZ, for login purpose
consider like if  take backup means it's not a cluster it is an unique instance only
if i connecftefd these below RDS together means - cluster- 
      RDS - replica
      RDS - master
      RDS - replica

cluster- more instance connected together means cluster

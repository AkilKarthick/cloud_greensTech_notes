RDS & DYNAMO

database,
 types of date::
structured      = infomration only we can put inside (for eg: EXCEL )   -- RDS used here
semi-structured = both way we can store data  --  no sql : dynamoDB
un structed     = video, audio , pdf, etc (we store in S3, EBS, EFS )

EXCEL we have rows & colums

--------

RDS
 we are going to create RDS 
login to AWS account,
seasearch for Aurora and RDS,

hint--

on vpc concept, we put database and backe on private subnet &
                fronet end on public subnet
if we want to more secure , we can put front end on private and load balancer on public then we expose
based up on organiztion and devops enginner convinent
------------

now if you need to create RDS you need -subnet groups- first
create a subnet for RDS
name:db-sub
description: db-sub
vpc: select you vpc 
availaibity zone: availibilty zone select or chose AZ
subnets: select subnet included on the AZ
click on CREATE database
 1.choose a DATABASE creation method
standard create
Easy create
2.Select Engine oPTIONs /engine type
  Mysql or postgreSQL
Aurora(Mysql compatabile) - aws managed SQL, 5times faster then mysql
Select Engine Version, for EG: Mysql 8.0.41
then
Templates, choose either
prodcuion 
or Dev/Test
or free tier

then 
Availability & durability, select deployment option
   Mutli AZ db cluster deployment (3 instance)
   mutli AAZ instance Deployment (2 INSTANCE)
   single AZ db insance deployment (1 instance)   = select this one

then
Settings
 DB instane identifier- means name 
then 
Credentials Setting
 Master Username: admin
select > Self Managed(create your own password or have RDS create a pwd that you manage)
Master password:   admin123
confim password:   admin123

then 
instance configuration,
    standard clasee - min 8gb
    memory optijmzed class - min 16gb
    burstable class - 1gb   cost you 18dollars

then on Storage
storage type,
 for Provisioned IOPS itslef we are spending 300dollars, 
 so change it to General purpose SSD
  Allocated Storage is min 20 is fine

now cost changed to 2dollar

then , on Connectivity
select Don't connect to an EC2 instance

VPC, select your vpc
public access> alway select NO





hit---
i put my database(RDS) not on single AZ i put on multiple AZ, for login purpose
consider like if  take backup means it's not a cluster it is an unique instance only
if i connecftefd these below RDS together means - cluster- 
      RDS - replica
      RDS - master
      RDS - replica

cluster- more instance connected together means cluster

master  - write
replica - read 
-------
RDS - prvide one endpoint url , we create username & password
application- datea logsi prsen here including queryeis

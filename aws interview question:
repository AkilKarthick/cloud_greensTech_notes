aws interview question:

what is EC2 instance and its types?

EC2 - elastic compute cloud;
a web servive that provide resizable compute capacity in the cloud
allow you to run virtual machine(intance ) on AWS

common instance types are:

General Purpose: t4g, t3, t2, m6g, m5
Compute Optimized: c7g, c6g, c5
Memory Optimized: r7g, r6g, r5, x2
Storage Optimized: i4, i3, d2
Accelerated Computing: p4, p3, inf1

2. steps to launch ec2 instances?

loginto aws console-ec2 dashboard
click launch ec2
choose an ami amazon machine image
---- is a template that contains the software configuration (OS, application server, applications).
select instance type eg(t2.micro)
configure instance details
add storage
configure security group
launch and download the key pair

for eg creatinnf free tire
give 
step1: name and tag >
      ami ie os needed for eg(amazon linux/mac os/ ubuntu / windows/ redhat/suse linux/debian)
      select free tire elligible eg microsoft windows server 2022 base
step2:then select instanve type
      for a sever how much ram/memory is needed ,how many virtual cpu is needed
      there are multiple family present on the intance type select based up on your need
      t2.micro free tire one 
      then
step3: key pair
      public key - it saved on a path during the time we are creating
      private key - we need to dowd this on our local

it will match those during the login

.pem - use with open ssh
.ppk - for use with putty

step4:on network setting 
      newtwork; - vpc 
      subnet - no preference
      auto assign public ip - enable
      firewall(security group)
            conrtoll the traffic for your instance
      allow RDP traffice - for windows

in security group
0---65535
rdp--3389   (remote desktop protocal)
ssh -22 (secure shell host) we need to enable this to login our machin
we can able to login our server only if the above rdp port num is enable

storage: max 30() for free tire
finally lanch instance  -- it is now in running state

select the isntance -> connect--> select RDP client
we can able to see 
      public DNS
      username
      click on the get password link
now we get the instanve id and key oaru assoicated with insatnve and we need to upload the 
private key
need to decrupt this 
open remote desktop protocal
      give public dns on compute gave username and pwd
      your server will up now ;)

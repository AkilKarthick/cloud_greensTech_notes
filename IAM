IAM
identiy access management

authentication - id alloted member can enter office
autorization - even id cardmemeeber can enter and have certian roles and permission

authentication
  user  - user defince panurtathu
  groups  - group of users
  roles -  we can give privilege to senior resource for temporary purpose
            client visit during we give temporary password/visitory ID

autorization
  policiyes  - DO AND don'ts permssions

AWS resources (ec2 instance is the resouce)
we can acess/modify/manage recouse via,  console management (GUI) , CLI,

how application work

client server conect via API is SDK software developmement kit

------------------------------------------------------
1. open IAM >IAM dashboard
2.create user
  name: ram
provide euser access to aws management console -optoinal    
              hint; on real time they only give iam user not root acount only billing 
                    EVEN admin has root 
                        for security breach 
i want to create an iam user

4.give custom password: Admin123

3.set permission
  gave permission option
  attach policy directly > policy can be *aws managed or *custom manaaged
i give IAM read only acccess for EG

5.create user

finally, we get

console sign in details,
  console sigin url |  eg: https://accountdetailnumber.sigin.aws.amazon.com/console
  user name: ram | 
  password: Admin123 | we can download this as CSV

https://accountdetailnumber.sigin.aws.amazon.com/console
  this is not secure, 
so go to dashboard > go to AWS Account Alias> create like: sample-test

now accountid got changed to 
https://sample-test.sigin.aws.amazon.com/console

open incognito browser to login as IAM user signin

hint: in realtime they give IAM account only
for billing: : root account> proof biling

so you only authozised to read IAM onlyyy user, RAM

now goint to create another user siva
and gave cli access and not management console access
    username:siva
    no permission
you may endup with ACCESS DENIED to IAM:createUser

now goint to create a group :DEV
add ram over there

policies: IAM full access

permission:
wihtin a group you can add max 10 policies
click on user> it shows ram

fro eg: dev team i gave required preiveldge

go to ram user > summary  you can able to see ACCESS KEY 1> means ram doesn't have CLI ACCESS 
you can enable that by go to Secrity credentials- enable there
you can create two at t time for a user that is used on CLI

CLI password is the access key

AWS CLI install
then 

aws --version
rm .aws  
ls -a| .aws  

first setp 


aws s3 ls  > you get unable to locate credentials. you can configure credentials by runung "AWS configure".
>ls -a > to find .aws file
>aws configure
it wil ask access key if 
aws access key id: myaccesskey
aws secret access key : mysecret
default output format : json
default region name: ap-south-1

now it you run this command
aws s3 ls > you get invalid access key  not present on the record
ls -a| grep .aws
.aws file got created

to configure multple user 

aws configure --profile siva
it ask fresh if! see below
aws access id:
aws secrete id;
default regionname:
output: json

now go to the console and create access key for siva>
copy that and put if on the above

asw s3 ls > you get error like invalid access key bcz you first create a dummy
aws s3 ls --profile siva 

no ging to give direct permission to siva > like create inline policies> 

inline policy means giveing specific permission to user,group and roles
we can't share among us, once delete the use it may disapper

------------

how to create policy::

create policy> select a service (EC2)
you can give action all or specifice action

you can add user ARN, it will come

we need to know json or Yaml format <

{

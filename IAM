✅ IAM – Identity & Access Management
🔹 What is IAM?

IAM (Identity and Access Management) helps you securely control access to AWS resources.

🔹 Authentication vs Authorization
1️⃣ Authentication — “Who are you?”

Office example:
A member with an ID card can enter the office.

AWS:

User → an individual identity created inside AWS

Groups → collection of users

Roles → temporary privileges

Example: Client visits → you give temporary visitor ID / temporary access

2️⃣ Authorization — “What can you do?”

Even if a person enters the office, he has only specific permissions.

In AWS:

Policies (JSON documents) → contain Allow / Deny for actions
Example: Start EC2, Stop EC2, Read S3, etc.

🔹 Accessing AWS Resources

AWS resources example: EC2 instance

You can access/modify/manage resources via:

Console (GUI)

AWS CLI

SDKs (API calls)

Applications work using:

Client ↔ Server via API

SDK = Software Development Kit (used to integrate AWS API)

🔹 Creating an IAM User (Example)

Open IAM → IAM Dashboard

Create User

Username: ram

“Provide user access to AWS Management Console” → optional

💡 Real-time hint:
Companies never give root account.
Even admins use IAM user, root is used only for billing or account recovery.

Set custom password

Example: Admin123

Set Permission

Choose Attach policy directly

AWS Managed / Customer Managed

Example: IAMReadOnlyAccess

Create User

You get:

Sign-in URL

Username

Password

CSV download option

Example URL:
https://account-number.signin.aws.amazon.com/console

🔹 Customizing Sign-In URL (Account Alias)

Default URL (not user-friendly):
https://123456789.signin.aws.amazon.com/console

Change alias:
IAM Dashboard → Account Alias

Example: sample-test

New URL:
https://sample-test.signin.aws.amazon.com/console

🔹 Logging in as IAM User

Open incognito → enter user sign-in URL

Remember:

For billing → root account

For daily AWS usage → IAM user (e.g., ram)

🔹 Example: Creating another user “siva”

Only CLI access

No console access

If no permissions → you will get:

❗ AccessDenied: IAM:CreateUser

🔹 Creating a Group

Create group: DEV

Add user: ram

Attach policies:

Example: IAMFullAccess

Max: 10 policies per group

User → Summary tab:
You can see Access Keys

If Access Key = None → user does not have CLI access
→ Go to Security Credentials → Create Access Key

One IAM user can have maximum 2 access keys.

🔹 AWS CLI Installation & Configuration

Check version:

aws --version


Try command:

aws s3 ls
Error:
❗ Unable to locate credentials

Configure credentials: using 'aws configure

It asks: below details

AWS Access Key ID:
AWS Secret Access Key:
Default region: ap-south-1
Output format: json


This creates:

~/.aws/
    credentials
    config

🔹 Multiple Users in CLI (Profiles)  use 

For siva:

aws configure --profile siva

Then use:

aws s3 ls --profile siva

you can create access key by clicking on
1.select cli access
then you got th access key with secrete key(one time viewinog)

🔹 Inline Policies

Inline policy: Direct permission for one user/group/role
Cannot be reused or shared, If the user is deleted → inline policy is also deleted
Used for very specific custom permissions

custom managed: means you created the policy , you can share across group.user
even you delete this it will reamain their

🔹 Creating Custom Policy (Example) 
using visual & Json

IAM → Policies → Create Policy
1.Select Service (Example: EC2)
2.Choose actions (All / Specific) 
all- means list/read/write/tagging etc
3.Add Resource ARN (all or specific)
4. we can give condition like requestcondition-
Review → Create

JSON editor is must known!

Example JSON format:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
                {
                "sid": "statement",
                "Effect": "Allow",  //allow or deney
                "Action": [
                  "ec2:Describe*"
                        ],
    "Resource": "*"
  }]
}

what is ARN?
what ever you hve created on aws which contain ARN
amaxon resoure name

for Region specif Resource we have to give Region
or global specif Resoure(like iam) no need to give

arn:aws:ec2:{ap-sount-1:{Account}:instnace/{Instance}

Accountid:is 134234124 something like this
Resoure: instance/elsaticip/user/group etc...


arn:aws:IAM::123423:group/{Instanceid}

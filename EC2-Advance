EC2-Advance

ec2--1ebs + 1 ebs

we are going to add Extra volume by hititng advance option fpr both windows and linux
add new volume
 size 5gb and change yes for Delete on termination option
   do launch the windows instance
     
on windows
     open disk Management
     open the unallocated disk 5gb
     make it as online by right click
     and do intialize disk option too > it will be on unallocated 
       now select New Simple Volume click on Next , you can split and use or use the same as per your need


for linux
1.  df -h    == to see the disk file system on human readable way
  it will only show the usage disk not the extra volume we have added 

  /dev/xvda1  8.0gb

2. lsblk    == list block to see the hidden storage of created volume
    we can able to see the 
  xvdb  3gb 0 disk

3. firstly need to specify this unallocated volume

  file -s /dev/svdb
 now  you volume is  a raw volume, so make file system for linux ext4 type volume 
  mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdb

   still it won't show on file system same like windows, but on windows you need to create a 
   directory using 
   
   mkdir greens

   now list those using ls
   now you need to mount this greens folder with 3gb volume. to commmunicate those

   mount /de/svdb greens/
   df -h

   now /dev/xvdb 3gb will list now on the file system after mouting

   -----------SNAPSHOT = backup of my ebs
   every 15 to 30 min backup for volume happne on real time 

   touch hi hello hey
   this will create three new file on greens folder

     go to snapshot on the dashboard comes under
     elastic Block storeage list

     goin to create a snapshot for 3gb

       create snapshot
       resource type . select voulume
        create snapshot

       to use this snapshot just go to instance 
       launch instance

       there under storage(volumes) we have advanced option 
       there we have snapshot option is there do select you created listed snashot on the drop down
         kindly give delete on termination to yes

         no need to mount it will format the disak of snapshot just mkdire and see 

         public ip- dynamic ip
         privte ip= static ip

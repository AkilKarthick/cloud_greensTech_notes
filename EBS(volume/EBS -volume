EC2-Advance

ec2- 1ebs + 1 ebs

One EC2 instance can attach multiple EBS volumes (up to 27 for most instance types)
for an one EC2- you can add 100 extra EBS, but varies official limit by instance type

1 EC2 server - add 100 EBS
1 EBS - max size 16TB, 

EBS:
block level storeage for EC2 instance
think of it like a harddisk attached to an Ec2 instance

keypoints:
works only inside a single AZ
can attach/detach to Ec2
persistent storage ( data stays even if Ec2 stops)
supports snapshots(s3 based backups)

feature od EBS

Durability( 99.9999 reliabilty)  data is stored across multiple servers in the same AZ
Envryption KMS
enable EBS encruption for snapshots, voume data and data in transit


Types of storage-
    object storage - s3
    block storage- EBS
    file storage - ???

we are going to add -Extra volume-  by hititng 
-advance option for both windows and linux
  1.add new volume
  2.size 5gb and 
     A.change 'yes' for Delete on termination option
do launch the windows instance
     
on WINDOWS:
     open disk Management
     open the unallocated disk 5gb
     make it as online by right click
     and do intialize disk option too > it will be on unallocated 
       now select New Simple Volume click on Next ,
       you can split and use or use the same as per your need

for LINUX:
1.  df -h 
      to see the disk file system on human readable way
      it will only show the usage disk not the extra volume we have added 

  /dev/xvda1  8.0gb

2. lsblk 
          list block to see the hidden storage of created volume
          we can able to see the 
            1.xdvda  8gb
            2.xvdb  3gb 0 disk
     if third voulem means 
          3.xvdc  2gb like that 

3. firstly need to specify this unallocated volume

  file -s /dev/xvdb
  you get, /dev/svdb: data

 now  you volume is  a raw volume, so make file system for linux ext4 type volume 
   >> mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdb

make file system -t for ext4(volume) to dev/xvdb path
   still it won't show on file system same like windows, but on linux you need to create a 
   directory using 
   
   >> mkdir greens

   now list those using ls
   now you need to mount this greens folder with 3gb volume. to commmunicate those

   mount /dev/xvdb greens/
   df -h

   now /dev/xvdb 3gb will list now on the file system after mouting

SNAPSHOT = backup of my ebs--

every 15 to 30 min backup for volume happne on real time 
so the concept is even the server crashed we can take backup with volume 

backup stored in S3 internally
snapshots can be copied to other regions
snapshot>volume>attach to EC2

   touch hi hello hey
   this will create three new file on greens folder

     go to snapshot on the dashboard comes under
     elastic Block storeage list

     goin to create a snapshot for 3gb

       create snapshot
       resource type . select voulume
        create snapshot

       to use this snapshot just go to instance 
       launch instance

       there under storage(volumes) we have advanced option 
       there we have snapshot option is there do select you created listed snashot on the drop down
         kindly give delete on termination to yes

         no need to mount it will format the disak of snapshot just mkdire and see 
--------------------------------

        1. public ip- dynamic ip (it will change whenever we start/stop our ec2)
        2. privte ip= static ip (fixed a iurukum)

         elastic ip --> static ip

go to elastic IP> allocate elastic IP address > 
then go to actions> associate Elastic ip address to any Instance

sso you can get the elasetic ip address for you Ec2 instance


| Storage Type    | Use Case                     | Protocol | Key Feature                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| **EBS (Block)** | Attached to EC2              | Block    | Low latency, per-AZ             |
| **EFS (File)**  | Shared storage for many EC2s | NFS      | Can mount across many instances |
| **S3 (Object)** | Any kind of file storage     | REST API | Infinite capacity + cheaper     |

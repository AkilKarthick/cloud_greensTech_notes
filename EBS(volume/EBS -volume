EC2-Advance

ec2--1ebs + 1 ebs
for an EC@- you can add 100extra EBS
1 EC2 server - add 100 EBS
1 EBS - max size 16TB, 
------------------
Types of storage------
  object storage - s3
  block storage- EBS
  file storage - 
---------------------
we are going to add -Extra volume-  by hititng -advance option for both windows and linux
add new volume
 size 5gb and change yes for Delete on termination option
   do launch the windows instance
     
on windows
     open disk Management
     open the unallocated disk 5gb
     make it as online by right click
     and do intialize disk option too > it will be on unallocated 
       now select New Simple Volume click on Next , you can split and use or use the same as per your need


for linux
1.  df -h    == 
            to see the disk file system on human readable way
           it will only show the usage disk not the extra volume we have added 

  /dev/xvda1  8.0gb

2. lsblk    == 
          list block to see the hidden storage of created volume
          we can able to see the 
          1.xdvda  8gb
          2.xvdb  3gb 0 disk
     if third voulem means 
          3.xvdc  2gb like that 

3. firstly need to specify this unallocated volume

  file -s /dev/xvdb
  you get, /dev/svdb: data

 now  you volume is  a raw volume, so make file system for linux ext4 type volume 
   >> mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdb
make file system -t for ext4(volume) to dev/xvdb path
   still it won't show on file system same like windows, but on linux you need to create a 
   directory using 
   
   >> mkdir greens

   now list those using ls
   now you need to mount this greens folder with 3gb volume. to commmunicate those

   mount /dev/xvdb greens/
   df -h

   now /dev/xvdb 3gb will list now on the file system after mouting

   -----------SNAPSHOT = backup of my ebs----------------------------------------------------------
   every 15 to 30 min backup for volume happne on real time 
so the concept is even the serfver crashed we can take backup with volume 

   touch hi hello hey
   this will create three new file on greens folder

     go to snapshot on the dashboard comes under
     elastic Block storeage list

     goin to create a snapshot for 3gb

       create snapshot
       resource type . select voulume
        create snapshot

       to use this snapshot just go to instance 
       launch instance

       there under storage(volumes) we have advanced option 
       there we have snapshot option is there do select you created listed snashot on the drop down
         kindly give delete on termination to yes

         no need to mount it will format the disak of snapshot just mkdire and see 
--------------------------------

        1. public ip- dynamic ip (it will change whenever we start/stop our ec2)
        2. privte ip= static ip (fixed a iurukum)

         elastic ip --> static ip

go to elastic IP> allocate elastic IP address > 
then go to actions> associate Elastic ip address to any Instance

sso you can get the elasetic ip address for you Ec2 instance

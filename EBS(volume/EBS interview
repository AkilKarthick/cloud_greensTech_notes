Great! Here's a set of **scenario-based AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store)** and **Snapshot** interview questions tailored for someone with **3â€“4 years of experience** in cloud/DevOps.

### âœ… **EBS & Snapshot â€” Scenario-Based Interview Questions (AWS Mid-Level)**

---

#### ðŸ”¹ **1. An EC2 instance becomes unresponsive, and you suspect it's due to EBS volume issues. How do you troubleshoot?**

**Expected Answer:**

* Stop the EC2 instance.
* Detach the root EBS volume.
* Attach it to another healthy EC2 instance as a secondary volume.
* Mount and inspect logs/data (`/var/log/messages`, `/var/log/syslog`).
* Fix issues (e.g., corrupt file system).
* Reattach volume to original instance and restart.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ **2. How do you back up an EBS volume without downtime?**

**Expected Answer:**

* Use **EBS Snapshot** (manual or automated).
* Snapshots are **incremental** and taken while the instance is running.
* For consistent backup of databases:

  * Either **freeze I/O** or use **application-level quiescing**.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ **3. What happens to the data when you terminate an EC2 instance with an attached EBS volume?**

**Expected Answer:**

* If **DeleteOnTermination = true** (default for root volume), the volume is deleted.
* For data volumes, set `DeleteOnTermination = false` to retain them.
* You can check or modify this setting using CLI or Console.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ **4. How can you restore a failed EC2 instance from its latest backup?**

**Expected Answer:**

* Identify the most recent **snapshot**.
* Create a new **volume** from the snapshot.
* Launch a new EC2 instance or attach the volume as root/data volume.
* (If boot volume) Ensure OS and boot files are intact.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ **5. How are EBS snapshots stored, and how do you optimize cost?**

**Expected Answer:**

* Stored in **Amazon S3** internally (not visible directly).
* **Incremental**: Only changes since the last snapshot are saved.
* Use **Lifecycle Policies** (via Data Lifecycle Manager) to:

  * Retain X days of snapshots.
  * Automatically delete old ones.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ **6. Can you share an EBS snapshot across accounts? How?**

**Expected Answer:**

* Yes:

  * Set **snapshot permissions** to make it shared (read-only).
  * Use the **snapshot ID** in target account to create a new volume.
* For encrypted snapshots:

  * Use **KMS key sharing** as well.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ **7. You need to create 10 EC2 instances with the same baseline data. How do you ensure consistent EBS volumes?**

**Expected Answer:**

* Create a **golden EBS snapshot** with all the necessary data/apps.
* Launch EC2 instances with volumes created from that snapshot.
* Automate this using **Launch Templates** or **CloudFormation**.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ **8. How do you automate daily EBS backups?**

**Expected Answer:**

* Use **Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM)**.

  * Define backup frequency (e.g., every 12/24 hrs).
  * Set retention policy.
* Tags on EC2 volumes can be used to apply policies.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ **9. Your application is experiencing slow I/O performance on EBS. What would you check?**

**Expected Answer:**

* Check volume type (gp2/gp3/io1).
* Use **CloudWatch metrics**: `VolumeReadOps`, `VolumeWriteOps`, `VolumeQueueLength`.
* Consider upgrading:

  * gp2 â†’ gp3 (cost-effective, provisioned IOPS)
  * io1/io2 for high-performance workloads
* Use RAID 0 if combining volumes.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ **10. You accidentally deleted an EBS volume. Can you recover it?**

**Expected Answer:**

* **No** if no snapshot exists.
* **Yes** if snapshot exists â€” create a volume from the snapshot and reattach it to an instance.

**how to update , package installation and managing **
how you will install any application on your mac/os

for linux we have a store called!!

-rhel, centos.fedora,amazon linux , suse = YUM is the playstore(yellow utilitiy manager)
--
-debian, ubuntu = apt ()
--

here in this exxample i'm working on redhat so 
you need to be a root user to instal any application

yum update  == this will update default system packages 

yum install packagename

for eg yum install httpd
here httpd is a webserver, if your applicatio is on local if you wannt to expose that to internet 

for eg

yum install -y    == this will direclty insatll the required package by considering yes as a reposne fro us

User and Group - 
file permission - 
---------------

1. whoami  
  -- dispay user name

2. sudo -i 
   to switch to root user
eg: 
sudo -i
pwd
/root 
 for non root user we get like /home/ec2-user

3. cat /etc/pa  - will print all user information

lets decode this below

ec2-user:x:1000:1000:cloud userz:/home/ec2-user:/bin/bash

username: password:userid:groupid:description(mention role): home path: /bin/bash(which means they can use shell ) 

userid: auto increment
groupid: auto increment

/bin/bash  - whcih means user can login
/bin/bash/nologin - means user can't able to login

4. tail /etc/password  -it will print last 10 lines
5. head /et/password - it will print first 10 lines

also we can give like below

head -3 /etc/passwd  -it will print firt 3 

6. cat /etc/shadow
print user duration of timing and logging

7. useradd manoj
  tail -3 /etc/passwd

it will shows like

one more data
ec2-user:x:1000:1000:cloud userz:/home/ec2-user:/bin/bash
manoj:x:1001:1002::/home/manoj:/bin/bash

8. cat /etc/group
will list grou and grouid

9. groupadd orange
  cat /etc/group
it will create new group orange :x:1002

intially no user present on the group so i'm going to add the user 

syntax: usermod -aG [group] [username] - so that new user added on the group

-a add
G group

usermod -aG orange manoj
usermod -aG orange manoj1

it will add like orange:x:1002:manoj,root

if you want to go like created user 
to swithc user
su username
su manoj
{manoj@ip-172-31-0-163] root $

cd + enter
redirect to home path

10, to create a file
  touch filname

11. to see th hidden files
  ll -a

usually single dot and double dott comes on all printed list
. single = represent current directory
.. double = represent parent directory

12. to change the file owner

touch filname
will create file on root user

-rw-r--r--. 1 root root date file
 > chown ec2-user file   - this will change the file to ec2 user owner
we can also give like
chown ec2-user:ec2-user file - this will change the group too

if want to change group only means

chown :orange file
cheown :groupname filename

if you want to change for all 

chown -R: orange file - this will chnage for all the sub dorectpry as well

-rwxr--r--
read  - only view
write - create file modify delete 
execute - to run the application eg .sh

here mostly .sh so it we wanna to execute that

-rwx r-- r--. 1 root root date file
user,group,other (for all other user)

to set this we ahve a methodology

read -4
write -2
execute -1

chmod - to change modify

chmod 111 all have execute permisson no righ read
chmod 311
chmod user (write+execute) group exect, other exeucte

another way is ther to add permission 

for eg:
mkdir play
ls -a
drwxr-xr-x 2 root rooot date play

chmod g+w play  = this will add write permission to the group
if 
chmod g=rw play = this will add read write only and remove the additional
chmod g-x play = this will remove /substract eh execute permssion 
chmod -R recuresively change all subdirect file as well

chmod +t play
now we get
-rwxrwxr--t 1 ec2-user orange date file
 file get highilgted 
denote sticky bit other can see the file but can 't edit even they haev permission
or ese
chmod1777 

simply said like mathavnaga aduthavange files read panamduiaythu called sticky bit

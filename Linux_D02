lets decode this below

ec2-user:x:1000:1000:cloud userz:/home/ec2-user:/bin/bash

username: password:userid:groupid:description(mention role): home path: /bin/bash(which means they can use shell ) 

userid: auto increment
groupid: auto increment

/bin/bash  - whcih means user can login
/bin/bash/nologin - means user can't able to login

4. tail /etc/password  -it will print last 10 lines
5. head /et/password - it will print first 10 lines

also we can give like below

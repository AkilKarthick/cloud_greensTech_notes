ec2

means Elastic cloud compute
oru vitaul sever, cloud la compute mathiri like VM

 virtual server on the cloud that can run applicaiton

1.how do you secure an EC2 instance?
  using security groups, IAM roles and by enabling encryption for data

2.how do you handle high availability and fault tolerence?

  we can enable autoscaling group & place Ec2 across multple availabilty zone, 
  attach elastic load balancer for distributed traffice


3.Can you explain the different types of instances available in Amazon EC2 and their use cases?
  each designed for specific purpose
  general purpose - balance ana cpu.n/w suitable for development environments
                     t2, M5
  compute optimized - higer perfomrance computing, like batch processing 
                      c6
  memory optimzed - realtime big data analytics, memory intersive application 
                    R5 & X1 series
  storage optimzed - local storeagfe performance workkng with large data sets, 
                      I3, D2. series
  GPU/Accelerated optimized - for machine learning and parallel computing task 
                           p,g series 

2.How does Amazon EC2 Autoscaling work, and how would you configure it to maintain a 
consistent number of instances during periods of high and low traffic?

Amazon EC2 Autoscaling dynamically adjusts the number of instances based on demand

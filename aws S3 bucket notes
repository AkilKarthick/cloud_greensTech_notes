**aws S3 bucket notes
=====================

s3- simple storage servie -- it is an unlimited storage

Types of storage in aws
1.Block-
2.Object- s3
3.File-

so i can store anything as an object is S3, 
most cheapest,cost kammi, 
high availalbitlit  &
durability ()

in S3 we have two concept::
        1.bucket-like a file system are contaiiner for data sotred in s3
        2.object- file & folder that we store on file system

for each aws account we can able to create "100" bucket only
but we can create any number of object on a bucket so it is unlimited!!

1 acc --> 100 bucket
1 object --> 5tb (size)

if we reached the limit 100 bucket per account , if we need additional 20 bucket then
we can reachout to aws support & tell the requirement the it's possible

s3
scalable storage in the cloud

we have
        1.general purpose bucket - it's like a ware house
        2.directory bucket - structural bucket
                                eg college related data;s on colg direcotory , clg id . student id. etc
                                each session data's present here
======================================================

how to create a s3 bucket || General purpose bucket ||

step1: select region first eg uk or india whateve
step2: bucket name should be unique, we have option like copy setting from existing bucket- option is there\
step3: object ownership, ACL should disabled(recommended)
        we have ACL access control list
        if this ACL is enable then, object'sin the bucket can be owned by other AWS account.
        access to the bucket and its object can be specififed by ACL.
if it is disable: then i have the privligedd to allow the people whom all are need to use

step4: 
we have public bucket- 
        private bucket-

Bucket --   object       --res
public      public   -everyone can accesss bucket
public      private  -only bucket accees is there, but object is private so obj is not accessible,only perimssion user can access that
private     private  -only permission user are allowded to access the bucket
private     public   -you have to go inside bukcet first to access obj so not acessible right?
                      obj is not accessible,
                      but each objECT has an unique URL . we can access over there using that URL.

step5: block public access- to make your bucket private
        if you are planning to host a static webiste, unchekc this bo so that
        everyone can access your website.

step6:bucket versioning
        
        
step7: we have encryption option

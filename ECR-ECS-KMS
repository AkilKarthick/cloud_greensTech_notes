ECR-ECS-KMS


step 1: do launch EC2 instance
  name: DOCKER
  amazon linxu AMI 2023
  t3.cmiro
  network seeting: ALL TCP
do launch instance

now do install DOCKER on the EC2 instance

sudo yum update -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras intall docker -y  not working
            sudo yum install docker -y 
sudo service docker start
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo docker info
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user

by default you are not allowded to use docker as a non root user
only via root user you allowded to use

so execute this command,
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user

> docker ps 
    = this will show the running container.

if you couldn't able to see the container means
do this

sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock  this is the docker engine 
change the perimssion of this 

if you hit 
docker ps > means it will run as non root user itslef

you got 
containerID | image | command | created | status | port | names
-----------------------

now on putty

ls 
vi dockerfile  - to provide docker file instructions
  created a docker file for application and apache installation

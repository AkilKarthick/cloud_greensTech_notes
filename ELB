elastic load balancer

elastic = choose autoscaling (automatic a server count increse/decreas)

for a application where does load balancer present?

for eg(facebook login )
when user hit the url -> it go to the loadbalancer\ here the LB tell where & which server to go
-------
we have 4 types of Loadbalancer

1.CLASSIC    - previous generation lb - distributing traffic across applicaton & n/w layer
2.APPLICATION - work only on Applicaiton layer 7 , for routing http & https slow traffice (microservice based archi)
3.NETWORK - work on transport layer 4 (quick one to handle traffice) workon tcp/udp
4.GATEWAY - work on n/w layer  (ip based ) 
-------
 Autoscaling types

1.vertical - size increase
2.horizontal - count increase

if we are goint to create classic LB?

  we need to have- launch Template
  -create on Load balancer
  - need to connect both and create autoscaling group
hint:
1 server, 1 template = 10 serfver createed from 1s,1t = classic lb is fine
when we go with multiple application with a single applicaiton = we go with application Lb 
----------
for Applicaion LB

  2 instance
  2 target group
  need to create LB
  set the path based routing - rules
-----------

1st laucnh template - create it
  name=MY-LT
  ami & os image = aazon linux 2023 6.1
  intance type = t2.micro
  keypair =
  n/w setting la
  this is a appliction nala we need to create port 80, but already we have alltcp
  at tcp - means all port is enabled
  how to create altcp?? therla
    click on create secutiy group!
    provide, secrity group name, descriptoin
    select your vpc
    on inbound security Group rules:
    Type - ALL TCP | port range : 0-65535
    source type - channged custom to anywhere  
a ALL tcp security group created , when next time you go there we can use that means 
  no need to open each port specifically
storage - no change
Advanced details::
  need to give one 
  
  script#! /bin/bach
  yum install httpd -y
  service httpd start
  echo <h1> ths is my LB instance $(hostname) </h1> " ? /var/www/html/index.html

finally -----create launch instance

only a template is created not the ec2 instance

now create loadbalancer

click on classic lb
create a classic loadbalancer
give basic configuration
  lb name = clb
  scheme:
    internet facing - you can hit this on brower
    internal - can't able to hit thsi on browser

network mapping:
 slelect default vpc
  select availability zone and subnets
  security group: all-tcp
  listener and routing: http 80 and http 80
  ---create loadbalancer

so far we created 
  load balancer
  template
we didn't created EC2 instance right

using autoscaling we connect, 
  we give lb and template to autoscaling so that it can connect.

Auto sclaing group--------

name: ASG
template : my-LT select your
next
subnet selct all
balanced best effort AZ
next
loadbalancer- attach to an existing lb  (classic loadbalancer)
for 
application,network & gateway loadbalancer- we use target group to connect the load balancer
next
configure group size & scaling -
 groupsiz
desired capacity- specifigy your group size -2

scaling-
 min= 2 max desired capacity =4
 next
do create Auto scaling group

now instance get created, by use autoscaling group + lb connected too
you can hit using 
  IP & loadbalancer DNS --- to view

----

now check go to the instance
two got created 

hit using public IP > this is my class ilb isntanve and host name pring onthe browser
check with another IP

now check with loadbalancer DNS name: you get the same ui 


this is my classic LB instance ip-172-31-3-182.ec2.internal
this is my classic LB instance ip-172-83-3-200.ec2.internal

above UI mari mari loadbalancer  piruchu kudukum, 

how can we check autoscal working we give minin 2 right!!

if you terminate one instance--> 

next 

Application Load Balancer ?? pending!!! with

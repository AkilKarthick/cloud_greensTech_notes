elastic load balancer

elastic = choose autoscaling (automatic a server count increse/decreas)

for a application where does load balancer present?

for eg(facebook login )
when user hit the url -> it go to the loadbalancer\ here the LB tell where & which server to go
-------
we have 4 types of Loadbalancer

1.CLASSIC    - previous generation lb - distributing traffic across applicaton & n/w layer
2.APPLICATION - work only on Applicaiton layer 7 , for routing http & https slow traffice (microservice based archi)
3.NETWORK - work on transport layer 4 (quick one to handle traffice) workon tcp/udp
4.GATEWAY - work on n/w layer  (ip based ) 
-------
 Autoscaling types

1.vertical - size increase
2.horizontal - count increase

if we are goint to create classic LB?

  we need to have- launch Template
  -create on Load balancer
  - need to connect both and create autoscaling group
hint:
1 server, 1 template = 10 serfver createed from 1s,1t = classic lb is fine
when we go with multiple application with a single applicaiton = we go with application Lb 
----------
for Applicaion LB

  2 instance
  2 target group
  need to create LB
  set the path based routing - rules
-----------

1st laucnh template - create it
  name=MY-LT
  ami & os image = aazon linux 2023 6.1
  intance type = t2.micro
  keypair =
  n/w setting la
  this is a appliction nala we need to create port 80, but already we have alltcp
  at tcp - means all port is enabled
  how to create altcp?? therla
    click on create secutiy group!
    provide, secrity group name, descriptoin
    select your vpc
    on inbound security Group rules:
    Type - ALL TCP | port range : 0-65535
    source type - channged custom to anywhere  
a ALL tcp security group created , when next time you go there we can use that means 
  no need to open each port specifically
storage - no change
Advanced details::
  need to give one 
  
  script#! /bin/bach
  yum install httpd -y
  service httpd start
  echo <h1> ths is my LB instance $(hostname) </h1> " ? /var/www/html/index.html

finally -----create launch instance

only a template is created not the ec2 instance

now create loadbalancer

click on classic lb
create a classic loadbalancer
give basic configuration
  lb name = clb
  scheme:
    internet facing - you can hit this on brower
    internal - can't able to hit thsi on browser

network mapping:
 slelect default vpc
  select availability zone and subnets
  security group: all-tcp
  listener and routing: http 80 and http 80
  ---create loadbalancer

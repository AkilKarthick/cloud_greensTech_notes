        different brand no big difference


1.hardware  -ec2
2.middleware  
    a.Webserver = static webpage (szme content)
    b.appserver = dynamic web page (different content)

for eg:
1 tier only UI
2. tier with DB
3. tire static/dymamic and DB

we are going to do app hosting

do launch instance- windows system:
  follow the same step for creating an EC2 instance
  then most importantly on Network Settings
  select --- Allow Http taffic from internet---
    becaseu for a website we should have http and https
  
  for EG:
  https://www.fb.com == s indicate it have sercurity certificate

step2:
for windows how to insatell IIS
  click on start->server manager hint(wait untill the blue line get completed)
it will get configure by automatically 
then on the serverManager-dashboard
  go to > ADD roles and feature
         clicl on next untill > serrver Roles session tab on popup window
          select Web SERvet (IIS) >> click on next finally do install 

now go to the file manager--

  locadiscC/inetpub/wwwroot/ delete the existing file presen there 
  and do cpy the static file content there

do laucnh instance- linux system::


  here also plz provide --http traffic from internet-- on network settings

step2: going to install the middelware
       >   yum install httpd -y

installation done for Apache

for checking purpose

do copy the linux IP address on the console0,
hit it on the broweer it should come apache server

even thought the installtion completed but Apache Http server is still inactive
we can che k by suing the command >> service httpd status

we need to execute this cmmand now
>> service httpd start

now go and check on the browser you can able to see ---1IT works --

cd/var/www/hmtl  - over here you need to put all our website content 

we have zip file only right on S3 so do copy the s3 private url and 

wget copyofTheS3URL
unzip filename

cd bootstrap-template 
cp -r ./var/www/html

it will copy the file to html location

now just hit the ip address on the browser you can able to see your website

how to deploy static website on windows and linux--


EC2 App Hosting

Application hosting

windows -- IIS (internet information service)
linux --Apach (httpd) / nginx  
        different brand no big difference


1.hardware  -ec2
2.middleware  
    a.Webserver = static webpage (szme content)
    b.appserver = dynamic web page (different content)

for eg:
1 tier only UI
2. tier with DB
3. tire static/dymamic and DB

3.sofware - we can say it as a Source code
------------

we are going to do app hosting

do launch instance- windows system:
  follow the same step for creating an EC2 instance
  then most importantly on Network Settings
  select --- Allow Http taffic from internet---
    becaseu for a website we should have http and https
  
  for EG:
  https://www.fb.com == s indicate it have sercurity certificate

step2:
for windows how to insatell IIS
  click on start->server manager hint(wait untill the blue line get completed)
it will get configure by automatically 
then on the serverManager-dashboard
  go to > ADD roles and feature
         clicl on next untill > serrver Roles session tab on popup window
          select Web SERvet (IIS) >> click on next finally do install 

now go to the file manager--

  locadiscC/inetpub/wwwroot/ delete the existing file presen there 
  and do cpy the static file content there 


----------------------------
do laucnh instance- linux system::


  here also plz provide --http traffic from internet-- on network settings

step2: going to install the middelware
       >   yum install httpd -y

installation done for Apache

for checking purpose

do copy the linux IP address on the console0,
hit it on the broweer it should come apache server

even thought the installtion completed but Apache Http server is still inactive
we can che k by suing the command >> service httpd status

we need to execute this cmmand now
>> service httpd start

now go and check on the browser you can able to see ---1IT works --

cd/var/www/hmtl  - over here you need to put all our website content 

we have zip file only right on S3 so do copy the s3 private url and 

wget copyofTheS3URL
unzip filename

cd bootstrap-template 
cp -r ./var/www/html

it will copy the file to html location

now just hit the ip address on the browser you can able to see your website

vpc -> virtual private cloud

how to find valid IP?
what is IP? a server

how IP is split up is 
 8.8.8.8 = total(32 bit)

each digit mazimum size is
0-255 = 256 total count

CIDR -> Classless inter domain routing

it will calculate the ip count

ipv4 = 32 bit range (we are goinng to see this)
ipv6 = 128 bit range

--------------------------
we are going to calculate ? 

out of 32bit  -32(if i plan to use 32 ) = 0 = 2 power of 0 = 1
32-31 = 1 = 2 power 1 = 2(total number of host/ ie 2 ip)
32-30 = 2 = 4 
32-29 = 3 = 8
32-28 = 4 = 16
32-27 = 5 = 32
32-26 = 6 = 64
32-25 = 7 = 128
32-24 = 8 = 256 (count of IP's)
   -23 =9 = 512
---------------

you can check this on CIDR calculator as well for more clarity!!

for EG: if you give 
10.0.0.0/24 on CIDR == you notive that 
        first IP is 10.0.0.0
        last IP is 10.0.0.255 (here last ip is fill)

10.0.0.0/23 on CIDR == you can see like
        first IP is 10.0.0.0
        last Ip is 10.0.1.255 (here once the last digit attain max 255 then it moved to next sessino) 

fourth 255 completed on 24th
thired 255 completed on 16th
second 255 completed on 8th

if client asked us for 1.5lakshs ip means? how you proceed?

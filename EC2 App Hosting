how to deploy static website on windows and linux--


EC2 App Hosting

Application hosting

windows -- IIS (internet information service)
linux --Apach (httpd) / nginx  
        different brand no big difference


1.hardware  -ec2
2.middleware  
    a.Webserver = static webpage (szme content)
    b.appserver = dynamic web page (different content)

for eg:
1 tier only UI
2. tier with DB
3. tire static/dymamic and DB

3.sofware - we can say it as a Source code
------------

we are going to do app hosting

do launch instance- windows system:
  follow the same step for creating an EC2 instance
  then most importantly on Network Settings
  select --- Allow Http taffic from internet---
    becaseu for a website we should have http and https
  
  for EG:
  https://www.fb.com == s indicate it have sercurity certificate

step2:
for windows how to insatell IIS
  click on start->server manager hint(wait untill the blue line get completed)
it will get configure by automatically 
then on the serverManager-dashboard
  go to > ADD roles and feature
         clicl on next untill > serrver Roles session tab on popup window
          select Web SERvet (IIS) >> click on next finally do install 

now go to the file manager--

  locadiscC/inetpub/wwwroot/ delete the existing file presen there 
  and do cpy the static file content there 


----------------------------
do laucnh instance- linux system::


  here also plz provide --http traffic from internet-- on network settings

step2: going to install the middelware
       >   yum install httpd -y

installation done for Apache

for checking purpose

do copy the linux IP address on the console0,
hit it on the broweer it should come apache server

even thought the installtion completed but Apache Http server is still inactive
we can che k by suing the command >> service httpd status

we need to execute this cmmand now
>> service httpd start

now go and check on the browser you can able to see ---1IT works --

cd/var/www/hmtl  - over here you need to put all our website content 

we have zip file only right on S3 so do copy the s3 private url and 

wget copyofTheS3URL
unzip filename

cd bootstrap-template 
cp -r ./var/www/html

it will copy the file to html location

now just hit the ip address on the browser you can able to see your website

vpc -> virtual private cloud

how to find valid IP?
what is IP? a server

how IP is split up is 
 8.8.8.8 = total(32 bit)

each digit mazimum size is
0-255 = 256 total count

CIDR -> Classless inter domain routing

it will calculate the ip count

ipv4 = 32 bit range (we are goinng to see this)
ipv6 = 128 bit range

--------------------------
we are going to calculate ? 

out of 32bit  -32(if i plan to use 32 ) = 0 = 2 power of 0 = 1
32-31 = 1 = 2 power 1 = 2(total number of host/ ie 2 ip)
32-30 = 2 = 4 
32-29 = 3 = 8
32-28 = 4 = 16
32-27 = 5 = 32
32-26 = 6 = 64
32-25 = 7 = 128
32-24 = 8 = 256 (count of IP's)
   -23 =9 = 512
---------------

you can check this on CIDR calculator as well for more clarity!!

for EG: if you give 
10.0.0.0/24 on CIDR == you notive that 
        first IP is 10.0.0.0
        last IP is 10.0.0.255 (here last ip is fill)

10.0.0.0/23 on CIDR == you can see like
        first IP is 10.0.0.0
        last Ip is 10.0.1.255 (here once the last digit attain max 255 then it moved to next sessino) 

fourth 255 completed on 24th
thired 255 completed on 16th
second 255 completed on 8th

if client asked us for 1.5lakshs ip means? how you proceed? 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

how vpc works flow diagram

consider a box

whatever subnets i'm going to create must comes under my VPC range
subnets like

public subnet
10.0.1.0/24  - total 256IP alloted for subnets

private subnet
10.0.2.0/24  - ))

netowrk flow should be there for both the subnets

Internet Gateway- helup us to 

it will take the vpc n/w and via route table provide n/w to subnet
this is how the default vpc look like below 

myvpc--> igw --> public routetable ----(public security group )---> publicSubnet(public ec2)

natgateway= it will take the n/w from public subnet and provide it to private subnet via route table
here to we have a private security group
-----------------------------------------


open networking and conetne delivery on aws
select VPC
on the VPC dashboard

if you go to your VPC , there already one default vpc listed there don't do any thing there

step1: click on create VPC
        gave name like MY-VPC
        ipv4 cide as 10.0.0.0/16
        click on create VPC
step2: subnets (public & private)
        click on create subnets
        select your VPC ID ON create subnets in this vpc
        give subnet name: PUBSUB
        ipv4 cidr as 10.0.1.0/24 (we are going to allocate 256 IP's)
        click on create subnet

        create subnet for private too

click on create subnets
        select your VPC ID ON create subnets in this vpc
        give subnet name: PVTSUB
        ipv4 cidr as 10.0.2.0/24 (we are going to allocate 256 IP's)
        click on create subnet

next create Internet Gateway::
        create ig
        name : MY-IGW         
        click on create internet gateway. it's state is in DETACHED initially
        and later we can attach > click on Actions> attach to VPC
        select your vpc on the Available VPC's box
        click on attach internet gateway

now need to create Route Table,
        on the dashboard it shows two route table intially
        one is default one and other is our VPC's one
we are not going to use the abve , going to create a new one 
        create route table
        name: pubRT
        select your VPC
now edit that routetable, click on add route and do select your internet gateway & give
0.0.0.0 public ip, & do save the changes

now we are going to associate public subnet with public related internet gateway!!
on subnet assocation > click on edit assocation
select PUBSUB , and do Save assocations

now going to create route table for private
name: PVTRT        
selct your VPC, do create route abel
initially we don't have nat but we have that subnet association option to associate our subnet first
associate your pvtsub with pvtrt

security groups::
create new
name: PUB-SG
        Description: PUB-SG
        select your vpc too
        need to give inboud rules(yarulaam ulla varalam)
        inbout rules        type == ssh, rdp, http & https
        finally create seucity grou;s
name: PVT-SG
        Description: PVT-SG
        here in inboud rules, Type select "Custom TCP" 
        Source as custom and 
        select PUB-SG, means we give like
whom all are comes under pub subgroup only come here on private like that we setuped here

now create instances,
here imporatny on the network settings

select your VPC on vpc-required
select pubsub (public subnet )
auto assigne public ip- enabled
security group, select public-sG
do launch instance

for private instacnte
name: private
on n/w settings,
select your vpcc
you private subnet
and disbaled the auto assign public ip is disabled
secity group: pub private SG
do launh the instance

going to create NAT gateway
create 
name :         my-nat
subnet:    (pubsub)
do allocate Elastic IP

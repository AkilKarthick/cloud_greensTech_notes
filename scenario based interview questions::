ğŸ”¸ Check Security Group (port 22 for SSH),
ğŸ”¸ Check if instance is running or in stopped state,
ğŸ”¸ Look at system logs via AWS Console
ğŸ”¸ Use EC2 serial console if no SSH access
ğŸ”¸ Check Network ACLs, Subnet route tables

2.our EC2 instance is slow. How do you analyze performance?

ğŸ”¸ Use top, htop, iotop, df -h, du -sh *
ğŸ”¸ Look at CloudWatch metrics (CPU, memory, disk IO)
ğŸ”¸ Check EBS performance
ğŸ”¸ Check background processes or zombie processes

Linux Basic Scenarios
15. Disk is full on EC2. What steps will you take?

ğŸ”¸ df -h to check usage
ğŸ”¸ du -sh * in /var/log, /tmp, /home
ğŸ”¸ Clean logs, rotate if needed
ğŸ”¸ Consider increasing volume size
ğŸ”¸ Delete unused Docker images or temp files

16. EC2 has high CPU. How to analyze?

ğŸ”¸ top, ps aux --sort=-%cpu, htop
ğŸ”¸ Look for stuck processes or runaway apps
ğŸ”¸ Check log rotation (logs flooding disk)

created on s3 bucket private and upload your static content wesite as a object 

now going to create a cloud front distribution name:
select single website or app - single domain

select orgin type : s3
select your s3 bucket 

waf- amazon internal threat intelligents
web application firewall = to check our application vulnarabilities, 

how you host a static conent?

cloud front > secured a use pana we use WAF to protect malciour attach, ddos attach

disable waf security it will cost higher


if your cloud front need to access that created S3 private bucket means , earlier you need to update bucke policy manually now no need 
aws itself update here go to BUCKER PERMISSINOn to see this policy


see here  oly that specific distrubiotn can use the getobjcet nu defined below on the bucket policy so so secure
  "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::14-08-25pvlk/*",
            "Condition": {
                "ArnLike": {
                    "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::823091237790:distribution/E1JN3EJWB4SA65"
                }

open the created distrubtioin of cloud front, you get the domain 

alternative domain names you can add via reoute 53

if you are using HTTPS means you need to update your SSL cerficate ther on the edit settings option 

,

any one can access this url on world, you can ask why we can host this on s3 itself but it's region specific
but cloud front is not region specific, even on cities also cloud front present it have no only on DC,




cloud formation

a devopse tool

infrastructer as code -tool

need to know json/yaml 

100 vpc creationg will take some large time on manual creation
but 10000 vpc created via cloud formation with in a seconds is possible 

in real time we are not using cloud formation why because we use terraform on devops 

5k plus provider so we use terraform for this

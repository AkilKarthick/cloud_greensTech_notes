--how to update , package installation and managing--

how you will install any application on your mac/os
forr linux we have a store called!!

-rhel, centos.fedora,amazon linux , suse = YUM is the playstore(yellow utilitiy manager)
-debian, ubuntu = apt ()

here in this exxample i'm working on redhat so 
you need to be a root user to instal any application

-yum update  == this will update default system packages 
*yum install packagename
+yum

for eg yum install httpd
here httpd is a webserver, if your applicatio is on local if you wannt to expose that to internet 

for eg

yum install -y      ==this will direclty insatll the required package
                      by considering yes as a reposne fro us

yum install -y nginx httpd    == this will install multiple 
                                application on a single command

yum infor nginx   == information of the nginx will list thier

yum remove nginx  == it will remove the application
